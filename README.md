# Task Manager
A task manager API which allows users to register, login, logout a user model which contains data such as username, encrypted password, local ID
Once a user has a user instance created and logged in they can create task instances based off a task model which contains data such as as description, completion, and user ID
To summarize it is the working back-end of a todo list web application

# What did I learn?

* I learned how to create a NoSQL database in MongoDB to store user and task instances that are created
* I learned how to structure the API using ExpressJS to allow the access and manipulation of permissible data
* I learned how to use Postman to build, test and modify CRUD functionality
